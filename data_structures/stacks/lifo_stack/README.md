# LIFO Stack

The LIFO Stack is the classic stack data structure. In this module you will need to implement various methods of the LIFO Stack. These methods are:

* `push(self, item)`: Pushes a single item on to the top of the stack.
* `pop(self)`: Removes and returns the top item on the stack.
* `peek(self)`: Returns the top item on the stack without removing the item from the stack.
* `is_empty(self)`: Returns a boolean value to indicate whether the stack is empty or not.
* `__len__(self)`: Returns the current number of items in the stack.
