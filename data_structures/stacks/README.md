# Stacks

Stacks are a type of data structure that generally take in new items and output the newer items first. The main example of a stack data structure is the [LIFO Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) which allows the user to push items on to the stack and pop off only the most recent. 

A good way to think about stacks is if you had a stack of dishes. You can only put new dishes on the top and you can only take dishes off the top.
