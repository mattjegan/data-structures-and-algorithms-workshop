# Queues

Queues are a type of data structure that generally take in new items and output the oldest items first. The main example of a queue data structure is the [FIFO Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) which allows the user to push items on to the end of the queue and pop off only the oldest item from the front of the queue. 

A good way to think about queues is if you were at a movie cinema. You want to buy a ticket so you enter a queue. You can only join the end of the queue and the next person to get their ticket can only be the person leaving the front of the queue.
