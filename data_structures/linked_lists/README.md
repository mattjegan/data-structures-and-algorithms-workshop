# Linked Lists

[Linked Lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) are a classic data structure that has been used to store various collections of data. They have the advantage over arrays that each node in the list can be stored in a different area of memory whereas an array needs a contiguous block of memory to store it's values. 

A linked list is usually made up of elements called nodes, these nodes often have pointers to other nodes, to indicate the next element in the list. A node may have a number of other attributes attached to it such as a value it is storing.
