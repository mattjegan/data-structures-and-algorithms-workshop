# Data Structures and Algorithms Workshop

This project aims to provide a number of empty implementations for various data structures and algorithms. For each module there will be tests provided so you can test your implementation and make 
sure that it meets the requirements of the particular data structure or algorithm.

## Structure

Inside the `data_structures` directory there are various data structures that you can implement. Also, solutions are provided in `data_structures/solutions`. To check your code before looking at the solution please run `pytest`.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/mattjegan/data-structures-and-algorithms-workshop
cd data-structures-and-algorithms-workshop
pipenv install
pipenv shell
pytest
```
